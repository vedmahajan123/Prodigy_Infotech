Prodigy Infotech – Task 02: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)
This repository contains my submission for Task 01 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech. Through this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset, exploring survival trends and visualizing key features.

📌 Task Overview
Objective:
Clean the Titanic dataset and create insightful visualizations to explore relationships between variables like gender, class, fare, age, and survival.

💡 This task helped me strengthen my data preprocessing and visualization skills using Python. I also gained a deeper understanding of real-world data analysis by identifying trends and patterns hidden in raw data.

I’m participating in this internship to gain hands-on experience, grow my portfolio, and apply my skills in data science and analytics to meaningful projects.

📊 Visualizations Performed
Bar Chart – Total survival count (Survived vs Died)

Grouped Bar Chart – Survival by gender (male vs female)

Grouped Bar Chart – Survival by class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)

Histogram – Age distribution with survival overlay

Histogram – Fare distribution with survival overlay

Bar Chart – Survival by family size (SibSp + Parch)

Bar Chart – Survival by port of embarkation (S, C, Q)

Heatmap – Correlation matrix between features


🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Platform: Jupyter Notebook

📌 Key Learnings
Females and 1st-class passengers had significantly higher survival chances.

Younger passengers and those with small families also had better odds.

Passengers from Cherbourg had slightly higher survival.

Fare and class were strongly correlated with survival.

📈 Future Scope
This cleaned and analyzed data can be used to train a machine learning model to predict survival, which could be a potential follow-up task or project.
