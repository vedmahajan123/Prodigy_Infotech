# 🚢 Prodigy Infotech – Task 01: Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis 

This repository contains my submission for **Task 01** of the **Data Science Internship at Prodigy Infotech**. Through this task, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset, exploring survival trends and visualizing key features.

---

## 📌 Task Overview

**Objective:**  
Clean the Titanic dataset and create insightful visualizations to explore relationships between variables like **gender**, **class**, **fare**, **age**, and **survival**.

💡 This task helped me strengthen my data preprocessing and visualization skills using Python. I also gained a deeper understanding of real-world data analysis by identifying trends and patterns hidden in raw data.

I’m participating in this internship to gain hands-on experience, grow my portfolio, and apply my skills in data science and analytics to meaningful projects.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Titanic_EDA_Task1.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the full code, data cleaning steps, and visualizations.
- `train.csv` – Titanic dataset (Kaggle) used for analysis.

## 📊 Visualizations Performed

1. **Bar Chart** – Total survival count (Survived vs Died)  
2. **Grouped Bar Chart** – Survival by gender (male vs female)  
3. **Grouped Bar Chart** – Survival by class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)  
4. **Histogram** – Age distribution with survival overlay  
5. **Histogram** – Fare distribution with survival overlay  
6. **Bar Chart** – Survival by family size (SibSp + Parch)  
7. **Bar Chart** – Survival by port of embarkation (S, C, Q)  
8. **Heatmap** – Correlation matrix between features  
9. **Violin Plot** – Age distribution by class and survival  
10. **Bar Plot** – Average fare by class and survival

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Platform:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Females and 1st-class passengers had significantly higher survival chances.
- Younger passengers and those with small families also had better odds.
- Passengers from Cherbourg had slightly higher survival.
- Fare and class were strongly correlated with survival.

## 📈 Future Scope

This cleaned and analyzed data can be used to train a machine learning model to **predict survival**, which could be a potential follow-up task or project.
